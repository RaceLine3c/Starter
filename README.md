# Racing starter 

The code based on a library [Nanpy](https://github.com/nanpy/nanpy-firmware) for the Raspberry Pi to control the Arduino.

This project consists in imitating the traffic lights of a race start with sound, traffic lights... (the lights are not of several colors maybe in a future update). So to do this project you'll need :

    - Raspberry Pi
    - Arduino
    - Jumper wires
    - Led
    - Stepper motor
    - Resistance 10 kOhm
    - Motions sensor
    - Speaker
    - Driver Motor L298N
